        <p class="paragraph">
            My name is Cavin Ngugi and this is my demo website. I have created this site to showcase the skills I have picked
            up from my time studying in Moringa School. I have also included a CSS framework known as bootstrap to make it look more
            stylish with less code. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            In my time in Moringa school we have been taught various technologies and how to use them. A good example would be: -
        </p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Version Control Systems i.e. Git</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
            </ol>
        <p class="paragraph">
            This information was taught in only a span of 2 weeks! Welp they weren't kidding when they said it was a coding
            bootcamp. From these 2 weeks we have all spent some sleepless nights trying to finish assignments on time while also
            debugging.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Once I finish my studies in Moringa, I plan to get some work experience in the software development field before I 
            finally end up starting my own company.
