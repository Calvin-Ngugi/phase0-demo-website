        <h1 class="title">Welcome To My Demo Website</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">My name is Cavin Ngugi and this is my demo website. I have created this site to showcase the skills I have picked
            up from my time studying in Moringa School. I have also included a CSS framework known as bootstrap to make it look more
            stylish with less code. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            In my time in Moringa school we have been taught how to use git as our version control system, HTML, CSS and a bit of
            JavaScript. And all of this information in a span of 2 weeks! Welp they weren't kidding when they said it was a coding
            bootcamp. From these 2 weeks we have all spent some sleepless nights trying to finish assignments on time while also
            debugging.
